## About this app

This app is a YouTube clone built using React, Node.js, Axios and MUI which I named WF Media.

It has features such as a homepage with categories, search functionality and recommended videos. Channel and video cards, functionality to control the video (pause, drag rewind etc...) and likes / views.

The app is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

It was built in React with Axios calls to RapidAPI YouTube API.
I utilized the JSMastery tutorial to learn more about API calls, useState, useEffect and other key React features.
